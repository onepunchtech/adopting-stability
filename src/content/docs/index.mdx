title: Adopting Stability
description: A hands-on workshop for adopting Nix to improve stability, safety, and reproducibility in software development.
---

*A hands-on workshop for adopting Nix to improve the stability of software development.*

---

## What This Is

This is a **practical workshop** focused on adopting **Nix** as a solution to real, recurring problems in software development:

- Fragile development environments  
- Inconsistent builds across machines and CI  
- Hidden differences between dev, CI, and production  

The goal is not to teach Nix exhaustively, but to teach **enough Nix to solve real problems**.

---

## Why Nix

Many teams already try to improve stability using tools like:
- language package managers
- lockfiles
- Docker
- CI pipelines

These help — but they only solve parts of the problem.

Nix approaches the problem at the system level, providing:
- **reproducible builds**
- **predictable development environments**
- **safer dependency upgrades**
- **clearer security and CVE response**
- **stronger guarantees across dev, CI, and production**

---

## Beyond Local Development

The workshop also covers using Nix to manage **deployment artifacts and runtime environments**, including Kubernetes.

This includes:
- generating Kubernetes manifests reproducibly
- sharing configuration safely across services
- reducing copy-paste YAML drift
- validating changes through builds and tests
- promoting known-good configurations through environments

The focus is on **making Kubernetes changes boring, repeatable, and auditable**.

---

## What the Workshop Focuses On

This workshop is designed to take participants:

> **From zero → to knowing enough Nix to use it confidently and productively**

The emphasis is on:
- hands-on usage
- real workflows
- understanding tradeoffs
- avoiding unnecessary theory

Participants will learn how to:
- use Nix for development environments
- build and test real software with Nix
- understand basic Nix expressions
- work with flakes and reproducible inputs
- read and modify simple NixOS modules
- manage reproducible Kubernetes configurations

---

## Who This Is For

- Engineers new to Nix
- Teams considering adopting Nix
- Organizations struggling with build, environment, and deployment stability
- Anyone responsible for maintaining reliable software systems

No prior Nix experience is required.

---

## What Success Looks Like

After the workshop, participants will:
- understand when Nix is the right tool
- feel comfortable using Nix day-to-day
- know how to debug common issues
- be able to apply Nix to real problems in their own environment

The goal is **confidence and orientation**, not mastery.

---

## Format

- Short, focused sessions  
- Hands-on, live walkthroughs  
- Real examples and workflows  
- Honest discussion of tradeoffs and limitations  

---

## Ownership

This workshop and its materials are independently authored and maintained.

If you’re interested in adopting Nix to improve stability, safety, and predictability across development, CI, and Kubernetes environments, this workshop is designed to help you get there.
