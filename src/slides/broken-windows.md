## Broken Windows

---

### Key point

Bastiat’s point wasn’t that fixing a window is bad.
It’s that we mistake activity caused by damage for progress.

---

### "Works on My Machine" Debugging

- Pairing to debug a build that fails for one person
- Comparing PATHs
- Reinstalling tools
- "Try upgrading/downgrading X"
- "Oh, I had that version locally"

---

### Seen

- You’re solving a problem
- You’re helping a teammate
- There’s visible progress

---

### Unseen

- Time not spent on product work
- Cognitive load of context switching
- Normalization of environment drift
- The fact that the build had no guarantees to begin with

---

### Onboarding as a Heroic Act

- Day one is always rough
- Internal docs + tribal knowledge
- Senior engineers walking new hires through setup
- Setup scripts that “mostly work”

---

### Seen

- Knowledge sharing
- Mentorship
- Team bonding

---

### Unseen

- Lost productive time across the team
- Knowledge trapped in people
- Drift between "documented" and "real"
- Repeated re-teaching of the same steps

---

### Tool Version Alignment Meetings

- "What version of X should we be on?"
- Migration docs
- Coordinated upgrade days
- Long tail of stragglers

---

### Seen

- Alignment
- Standardization
- Governance

---

### Unseen

- Time spent coordinating what could be enforced
- Social solutions to technical problems
- Drift returning between meetings

---

### Lesson

- The seen work feels productive because it’s visible and necessary.
- The unseen cost is that this work exists at all.
- Reproducible systems reduce unseen costs by turning them into explicit inputs and mechanical processes.
